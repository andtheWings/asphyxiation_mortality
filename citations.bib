  abstract = {Policymakers and advocates have spent decades trying to respond to the reality and consequences of racial residential segregation. Recently, there has been a growing effort to confront rising levels of economic segregation as well. While substantial evidence exists on the harms of segregation for people with lower incomes or racial and ethnic minorities, its effect on regional outcomes has been less clear. Urban’s report addresses these questions and concerns by analyzing the 100 most populous commuting zones (which are similar to metropolitan areas) between 1990 and 2010. We found that one pattern holds across all of our measurements: economic segregation impedes the economic progress of a region’s residents, but particularly its black residents. This research has three main takeaways: {$<$}ul{$>$} {$<$}li{$>$}The country is changing in terms of spatial patterns but remains starkly segregated by race and income.{$<$}/li{$>$} {$<$}li{$>$}There is a real cost to segregation, which varies by race and ethnicity.{$<$}/li{$>$} {$<$}li{$>$}Chicago continues to struggle as a highly segregated metropolitan area, with major effects for all residents.{$<$}/li{$>$} {$<$}/ul{$>$} Economic segregation fell in the 1990s but started up again after 2000. Between 2000 and 2010, 72 commuting zones saw their economic segregation levels increase. Overall, blacks and whites tend to be more segregated from one another than Latinos and whites, although black-white segregation declined, on average, between 1990 and 2010. More racially segregated regions also tend to also be more economically segregated. The interconnected relationship between economic and racial segregation speaks to the fact that the costs segregation imposes on residents vary by race and ethnicity. Indeed, when looking at the effect of segregation on individual racial groups, the clearest story emerges for black residents: {$<$}ul{$>$} {$<$}li{$>$}Higher levels of economic segregation are associated with lower median and per capita income for blacks, while higher levels of black-white segregation are associated with lower black per capita income. Neither economic segregation nor racial segregation is significantly related to white or Latino median or per capita income.{$<$}/li{$>$} {$<$}li{$>$}Higher levels of black-white segregation are also associated with lower levels of four-year college degree attainment for both blacks and whites, as well as higher homicide rates.{$<$}/li{$>$} {$<$}/ul{$>$} In examining segregation within the Chicago region and how it influences quality of life outcomes there, we found mixed results. Although regional segregation levels have fallen slightly in recent decades, it remains one of the most segregated regions in the country, in economic segregation and especially in black-white and Latino-white segregation. We then estimated how much segregation costs the Chicago region by using our analysis results to determine how regional outcomes would change if Chicago’s segregation fell. If, for example, Chicago could reduce its level of economic segregation to the average level of the 100 largest commuting zones, black per capita incomes would go up an estimated 2.7 percent (or \$527), with an overall aggregate increase of \$772 million. And if Chicago could reduce its level of black-white racial segregation to the average level of the 100 largest commuting zones, we estimate the following: {$<$}ul{$>$} {$<$}li{$>$}Black per capita incomes would increase 12.4 percent (or \$2,455).{$<$}/li{$>$} {$<$}li{$>$}Educational attainment rates for both black and white residents would increase 2 percent each, with 83,000 more adults completing a college degree (78 percent of these new graduates would be white; 22 percent would be black). {$<$}/li{$>$} {$<$}li{$>$}Finally, the city’s highly documented homicide rate would drop 30 percent (e.g., the 553 homicides in 2010 would fall to 386, a decrease of 167 homicides).{$<$}/li{$>$} {$<$}/ul{$>$} This report represents the first step in mapping out the implications of current trends on the Chicago region’s future trajectory, and to assess how policy levers could address these developments and promote more equitable pathways.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Many studies of sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) have focused on individual domains of risk factors (maternal, infant, and environmental), resulting in limited capture of this multifactorial outcome. The objective of this study was to examine the geographic distribution of SUID in San Diego County, and assess maternal, infant, and environmental risk factors from a large, administrative research platform. STUDY DESIGN: Births in California between 2005 and 2017 were linked to hospital discharge summaries and death files. From this retrospective birth cohort, cases of SUID were identified from infant death files in San Diego County. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for infant, maternal, and environmental factors and SUID in multivariable Cox regression analysis. Models were adjusted for maternal sociodemographic characteristics and prenatal nicotine exposure. RESULTS: There were 211 (44/100,000 live births; absolute risk 0.04\%) infants with a SUID among 484,905 live births. There was heterogeneity in geographic distribution of cases. Multiparity (0.05\%; aHR 1.4, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.1, 1.9), maternal depression (0.11\%; aHR 1.8, 95\% CI 1.0, 3.4), substance-related diagnoses (0.27\%; aHR 2.3, 95\% CI 1.3, 3.8), cannabis-related diagnosis (0.35\%; aHR 2.7, 95\% CI 1.5, 5.0), prenatal nicotine use (0.23\%; aHR 2.5, 95\% CI 1.5, 4.2), preexisting hypertension (0.11\%; aHR 2.3, 95\% CI 1.2, 4.3), preterm delivery (0.09\%; aHR 2.1, 95\% CI 1.5, 3.0), infant with a major malformation (0.09\%; aHR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.1, 3.6), respiratory distress syndrome (0.12\%; aHR 2.6, 95\% CI 1.5, 4.6), and select environmental factors were all associated with SUID. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple risk factors were confirmed and expanded upon, and the geographic distribution for SUID in San Diego County was identified. Through this approach, prevention efforts can be targeted to geographies that would benefit the most.},

  abstract = {In 2010, the long form Decennial Census was not used for the first time in several decades, replaced instead by the American Community Survey (ACS). While the ACS has been collecting data for more than a decade, the first census tract results were released in 2010. The ACS collects its data based on a rolling sample. It is purported to have many advantages over the Decennial Census, including frequently updated data, less overall cost, and better coverage. We have found, however, that the ACS can produce highly inaccurate data, in part because of reliance on extremely small samples in sparsely populated neighborhoods. We explore these dynamics through a community survey which replicates ACS questions while employing the old Decennial Census long form sampling strategy of requesting information from one in six households in a single inner city census tract in Nashville, Tennessee. Our results show that the ACS has grossly underestimated the total population and the number of people living in poverty in the neighborhood, among other variables of interest. Through an examination of the number of census tracts with very small sample sizes and a comparison of recent ACS results with the 2010 Decennial Census, we show that the problems identified in this single tract occur throughout the country. In addition, we consider how statistical profiles of neighborhoods derived from the ACS and other data sources enable wide ranges of action in those neighborhoods, action which can be harmful given inaccurate and/or decontextualized data.},

Bivariate Moran's I analysis revealed significant clustering of high SVI ranking with low COVID-19 vaccination rates (1.00, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and high smoothed mortality rates (0.61,~p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Regression revealed that for each 10\% increase in SVI ranking, COVID-19 vaccination rates decreased by 3.02-fold (95\% CI\,=\,3.73-2.30), and mortality rates increased by a factor of 1.19 (95\% CI\,=\,0.99-1.43).~SVI values are spatially linked and significantly associated with Louisiana's COVID-19-related vaccination and mortality rates. We also found that vaccination uptake was higher in whites than in blacks. These findings can help identify regions with low vaccination rates and high mortality, enabling the necessary steps to increase vaccination rates in disadvantaged neighborhoods.},

  abstract = {Background The addition of neonatal (NN) mortality targets in the Sustainable Development Goals highlights the increased need for age-specific quantification of mortality trends, detail that is not provided by summary birth histories (SBHs). Several methods exist to indirectly estimate trends in under-5 mortality from SBHs; however, efforts to monitor mortality trends in important age groups such as the first month and first year of life have yet to utilize the vast amount of SBH data available from household surveys and censuses. Methods and findings We analyzed 243 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) from 76 countries, which collected both complete and SBHs from 8.5 million children from 2.3 million mothers to develop a new empirically based method to indirectly estimate time trends in age-specific mortality. We used complete birth history (CBH) data to train a discrete hazards generalized additive model in order to predict individual hazard functions for children based on individual-, mother-, and country-year-level covariates. Individual-level predictions were aggregated over time by assigning probability weights to potential birth years from mothers from SBH data. Age-specific estimates were evaluated in three ways: using cross-validation, using an external database of an additional 243 non-DHS census and survey data sources, and comparing overall under-5 mortality to existing indirect methods. Our model was able to closely approximate trends in age-specific child mortality. Depending on age, the model was able to explain between 80\% and 95\% of the variation in the validation data. Bias was close to zero in every age, with median relative errors spanning from 0.96 to 1.09. For trends in all under-5s, performance was comparable to the methods used for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study and significantly better than the standard indirect (Brass) method, especially in the 5 years preceding a survey. For the 15 years preceding surveys, the new method and GBD methods could explain more than 95\% of the variation in the validation data for under-5s, whereas the standard indirect variants tested could only explain up to 88\%. External validation using census and survey data found close agreement with concurrent direct estimates of mortality in the NN and infant age groups. As a predictive method based on empirical data, one limitation is that potential issues in these training data could be reflected in the resulting application of the method out of sample. Conclusions This new method for estimating child mortality produces results that are comparable to current best methods for indirect estimation of under-5 mortality while additionally producing age-specific estimates. Use of such methods allows researchers to utilize a massive amount of SBH data for estimation of trends in NN and infant mortality. Systematic application of these methods could further improve the evidence base for monitoring of trends and inequalities in age-specific child mortality.},

  abstract = {Since 2000, many countries have achieved considerable success in improving child survival, but localized progress remains unclear. To inform efforts towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.2—to end preventable child deaths by 2030—we need consistently estimated data at the subnational level regarding child mortality rates and trends. Here we quantified, for the period 2000–2017, the subnational variation in mortality rates and number of deaths of neonates, infants and children under 5 years of age within 99 low- and middle-income countries using a geostatistical survival model. We estimated that 32\% of children under 5 in these countries lived in districts that had attained rates of 25 or fewer child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2017, and that 58\% of child deaths between 2000 and 2017 in these countries could have been averted in the absence of geographical inequality. This study enables the identification of high-mortality clusters, patterns of progress and geographical inequalities to inform appropriate investments and implementations that will help to improve the health of all populations.},

  abstract = {Research supports that exposure to stressors (e.g., perceived stress and racism) during pregnancy can negatively impact the immune system, which may lead to infection and ultimately increases the risk for having a preterm or low-birthweight infant. It is well known that Black women report higher levels of stressors at multiple timepoints across pregnancy compared with women of all other racial and ethnic groups. This study addresses gaps in the literature by describing pregnant and early post-partum Black women’s exposures to structural racism and self-reported experiences of racial discrimination, and the extent to which these factors are related. We used a cross-sectional study design to collect data related to exposures to racism from pregnant and early post-partum Black women residing in Oakland, California, from January 2016 to December 2017. Comparative analysis revealed that living in highly deprived race + income neighborhoods was associated with experiencing racial discrimination in three or more situational domains (p = .01). Findings show that Black women are exposed to high levels of racism that may have negative impacts on maternal health outcomes.},

Modeling the structure and dynamics of segregation is a pressing problem for sociology and urban planning, but existing methods have limitations. In this paper, we develop a suite of methods, grounded in information theory, for studying the spatial structure of segregation. We first advance existing profile and decomposition methods by posing two related regionalization methods, which allow for profile curves with nonconstant spatial scale and decomposition analysis with nonarbitrary areal units. We then formulate a measure of local spatial scale, which may be used for both detailed, within-city analysis and intercity comparisons. These methods highlight detailed insights in the structure and dynamics of urban segregation that would be otherwise easy to miss or difficult to quantify. They are computationally efficient, applicable to a broad range of study questions, and freely available in open source software.},

It also examines the potential value of the SVI by exploring the impact of Hurricane Katrina on local populations.}

The diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) has gained broader acceptance and use. Little is known about PGD in mothers after SIDS.Between May 2013 and July 2016, we assessed 49 SIDS-bereaved mothers living in informal settlements near Cape Town, South Africa, and on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and 359 SIDS-bereaved mothers affiliated with SIDS parent-support organizations in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. We examined PGD symptom severity and diagnostic prevalence rates between the samples and other significant grief indicators during the period 2 to 48 months after the deaths of their infants.Extremely high, persistent, and similar rates of PGD were found in both samples at every time interval. The prevalence of PGD was 50.0\% in either sample (mean months from loss: 20.5 vs 24.9). Daily, intrusive emotional pain or yearning was found in 68.1\% of subjects; yearning was significantly associated with emotional pain (P \&lt; .0001). Role confusion and anger were the most prevalent symptoms, reported by the majority at every time interval. Rates of role confusion, anger, and diminished trust in others remained constant. Acceptance was less prevalent than other grief indicators at every interval.Severe symptoms and heightened risk for PGD was seen in mothers after their infants died of SIDS, with discernible symptom profiles. Given their involvement with families after SIDS, pediatricians may have a unique role in identifying this problem and helping address its consequences.}

First, a basic misclassification problem is illustrated using data from a study of sudden infant death syndrome. Bayesian analyses are then given. These analyses can be conducted directly, or by converting actual-data records to incomplete records and prior distributions to complete-data records, then applying missing-data techniques to the augmented data set. The analyses can easily incorporate any complete (‘validation’ or second-stage) data that might be available, as well as adjustments for confounding and selection bias. The approach illustrates how conventional analyses depend on implicit certainty that bias parameters are null and how these implausible assumptions can be replaced by plausible priors for bias parameters.}

  abstract = {Economic differences and proximal risk factors do not fully explain the persistent high infant mortality rates of African Americans (blacks). The authors hypothesized that racial residential segregation plays an independent role in high black infant mortality rates. Segregation restricts social and economic advantage and imposes negative environmental exposures that black women and infants experience. The study sample was obtained from the 2000–2002 US Linked Birth/Infant Death records and included 677,777 black infants residing in 64 cities with 250,000 or more residents. Outcomes were rates of all-cause infant mortality, postneonatal mortality, and external causes of death. Segregation was measured by using the isolation index (dichotomized at 0.60) from the 2000 US Census Housing Patterns. Propensity score matching methods were used. After matching on propensity scores, no independent effect of segregation on black infant mortality rates was found. Results show little statistical evidence that segregation plays an independent role in black infant mortality. However, a key finding is that it is difficult to disentangle contextual effects from the characteristics of individuals.}

BACKGROUND: The SVI is a measure used in emergency preparedness to identify need for resources in the event of a disaster or hazardous event, ranking each census tract on 15{$\mkern1mu$}demographic/social factors. METHODS: Moderate-severely injured adult patients treated at 1 of 3 level-1 trauma centers were prospectively followed 6 to 14{$\mkern1mu$}months post-injury. These data were matched at the census tract level with overall SVI percentile rankings. Patients were stratified based on SVI quartiles, with the lowest quartile designated as low SVI, the middle 2 quartiles as average SVI, and the highest quartile as high SVI. Multivariable adjusted regression models were used to assess whether SVI was associated with long-term outcomes after injury. RESULTS: A total of 3153 patients were included [54\% male, mean age 61.6 (SD = 21.6)]. The median overall SVI percentile rank was 35th (IQR: 16th-65th). compared to low SVI patients, high SVI patients were more likely to have new functional limitations [odds ratio (OR), 1.51; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.92), to not have returned to work (OR, 2.01; 95\% CI, 1.40-2.89), and to screen positive for post-traumatic stress disorder (OR, 1.56; 95\% CI, 1.12-2.17). Similar results were obtained when comparing average with low SVI patients, with average SVI patients having significantly worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The SVI has potential utility in predicting individuals at higher risk for adverse long-term outcomes after injury. This measure may be a useful needs assessment tool for clinicians and researchers in identifying communities that may benefit most from targeted prevention and intervention efforts.},

Fewer reported avoiding soft bedding (42.4\%) and using a separate approved sleep surface (31.8\%). Reported receipt of provider advice ranged from 48.8\% (room-sharing without bed-sharing) to 92.6\% (back sleep position). Differences by sociodemographic, behavioral, and health care characteristics were larger for safe sleep practices (∼10–20 percentage points) than receipt of advice (∼5–10 percentage points). Receipt of provider advice was associated with increased use of safe sleep practices, ranging from 12\% for room-sharing without bed-sharing (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.12; 95\% confidence interval: 1.09–1.16) to 28\% for back sleep position (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.28; 95\% confidence interval: 1.21–1.35). State-level differences in safe sleep practices spanned 20 to 25 percentage points and did not change substantially after adjustment for available characteristics.Safe infant sleep practices, especially those other than back sleep position, are suboptimal, with demographic and state-level differences indicating improvement opportunities. Receipt of provider advice is an important modifiable factor to improve infant sleep practices.}

  abstract = {Background Social and environmental factors play an important role in the rising health care burden of cardiovascular disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) from US census data as a tool for public health officials to identify communities in need of support in the setting of a hazardous event. SVI (ranging from a least vulnerable score of 0 to a most vulnerable score of 1) ranks communities on 15 social factors including unemployment, minoritized groups status, and disability, and groups them under 4 broad themes: socioeconomic status, housing and transportation, minoritized groups, and household composition. We sought to assess the association of SVI with self-reported prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Methods and Results We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of adults (≥18\,years) in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2016 to 2019. Data regarding self-reported prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities (including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, substance use), and ASCVD was captured using participants' response to a structured telephonic interview. We divided states on the basis of the tertile of SVI (first-participant lives in the least vulnerable group of states, 0-0.32; to third-participant lives in the most vulnerable group of states, 0.54-1.0). Multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, sex, employment, income, health care coverage, and association with federal poverty line were constructed to assess the association of SVI with cardiovascular comorbidities. Our study sample consisted of 1\,745\,999 participants ≥18\,years of age. States in the highest (third) tertile of social vulnerability had predominantly Black and Hispanic adults, lower levels of education, lower income, higher rates of unemployment, and higher rates of prevalent comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, substance use, and ASCVD. In multivariable logistic regression models, individuals living in states in the third tertile of SVI had higher odds of having hypertension (odds ratio (OR), 1.14 [95\% CI, 1.11-1.17]), diabetes (OR, 1.12 [95\% CI, 1.09-1.15]), hyperlipidemia (OR, 1.09 [95\% CI, 1.06-1.12]), chronic kidney disease (OR, 1.17 [95\% CI, 1.12-1.23]), smoking (OR, 1.05 [95\% CI, 1.03-1.07]), and ASCVD (OR, 1.15 [95\% CI, 1.12-1.19]), compared with those living in the first tertile of SVI. Conclusions SVI varies across the US states and is associated with prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities and ASCVD, independent of age, race and ethnicity, sex, employment, income, and health care coverage. SVI may be a useful assessment tool for health policy makers and health systems researchers examining multilevel influences on cardiovascular-related health behaviors and identifying communities for targeted interventions pertaining to social determinants of health.},

Public health and geographical research has been slow to recognize high data uncertainty of ACS estimates, even though ACS data are widely accepted data sources in neighborhood health studies and health policies. Detecting spatial autocorrelation patterns of health indicators on ACS data can be distorted to the point that scholars may have difficulty in perceiving the true pattern. We examine the statistical properties of spatial autocorrelation statistics of areal incidence rates based on ACS data. In a case study of teen birth rates in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, in 2010, Global and Local Moran’s I statistics estimated on 5-year ACS estimates (2006–2010) are compared to ground truth rate estimates on actual counts of births certificate records and decennial-census data (2010). Detected spatial autocorrelation patterns are found to be significantly different between the two data sources so that actual spatial structures are misrepresented. We warn of the possibility of misjudgment of the reality and of policy failure and argue for new spatially explicit methods that mitigate the biasedness of statistical estimations imposed by the uncertainty of ACS data.},

  abstract = {Objectives To examine the characteristics and circumstances of infants who died while sleeping or in a sleep environment and compare deaths classified as either unintentional asphyxia or an unexplained cause. Design A retrospective cohort study. Setting Data were extracted from the National Fatality Review Case Reporting System and Florida Vital Statistics databases. Participants Data on 778 sleep-related infant deaths occurring from 2014 to 2018 in Florida were analysed. Primary outcome measure Cause of death classification as unintentional asphyxia or unexplained. Results Overall, 36\% (n=276) of sleep-related infant deaths in this study sample were classified as resulting from an unexplained cause compared with unintentional asphyxia. Most infants were reported to be in an adult bed (60\%; n=464) and sharing a sleep surface with a person or animal (60\%; n=468); less than half (44\%; n=343) were reportedly placed to sleep on their back. After controlling for the influence of other independent variables, female sex (adjusted risk ratio: 1.36; 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.74) and fully obstructed airway condition (adjusted risk ratio: 0.30; 95\% CI 0.18 to 0.50) were associated with an unexplained cause of death. Conclusions The results of this analysis indicate that sleep environment hazards remain prevalent among infants who die suddenly and unexpectedly, regardless of the cause of death determination. While significant differences were observed for some factors, in many others the distributions of both demographic and incident characteristics were similar between unexplained deaths and those resulting from asphyxia. The results of this study support growing evidence that unsafe sleep environments contribute to all forms of sudden unexpected infant death, underscoring the need for standardising cause of death determination practices and promoting consistent, high-quality forensic investigations to accurately explain, monitor and prevent these deaths.},

The study utilized 10 years of retrospective birth history of women from the fourth round of NFHS-4 (2015–16). Findings suggest, except Kerala, there was a significant amount of clustering of infant deaths in families in the selected Indian states. The maximum impact of clustering was observed in Assam, followed by Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh. The estimated residual spatial effect was statistically significant in all the states, with the maximum effect being in Assam and Chhattisgarh. The risk of infant death in Assam was higher in the north-eastern districts and lower in the southern districts of the state. Mother's age at child birth had a nonlinear effect on infant death in all the states, although significant effects were observed only in Bihar and Assam. In both of these states, mother's age at child birth had a “U-shape,” showing that the risk of infant death was higher at both earlier and later ages of mother's reproductive period. With the exception of Kerala, all the other selected states in the study had an “elongated L shaped” pattern, showing that in the early ages of the reproductive period, the risk of infant death was very high and that it gradually decreased with age and remained constant thereafter. In Kerala, mother's age at child birth was a straight line, implying that the risk of infant death was constant across the reproductive age of women. In order to keep infant mortality at a low level and to achieve better maternal and child health outcomes, the government needs to target families experiencing multiple infant deaths. In addition, programs must take into consideration the prevailing state-specific spatial heterogeneity in infant deaths and factors like mother's age at child birth.},

Next, we describe the diagnostic shift in reporting and provide possible explanations as to why it occurred. We include a discussion of why using a single code to monitor sudden unexpected and unexplained infant deaths is no longer informative and discuss how new efforts to group codes for surveillance may allow for more consistent monitoring and comparison across jurisdictions and countries. Finally, we provide a description of the epidemiologic profile of SIDS and SUID, including information about current rates and historical trends, and sudden unexpected death in children 1 year old and over.},

  abstract = {Background: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden, unexplained death of infants {$<$}1 year old. SIDS remains a leading cause of death in US infants. We aim to identify associations between SIDS and race/ethnicity, birth weight/gestational age, and socioeconomic/environmental factors in North Carolina (NC) to help identify infants at risk for SIDS., Methods and Results: In this IRB-approved study, infant mortality 2007–2016 and death certificate-linked natality 2007–2014 were obtained from the NC Department of Health and Human Services. General, NC natality statistics 2007–2016 were obtained from CDC Wonder. Association between SIDS/total infant death and covariates (below) were calculated. Total infant mortality decreased 2007–2016 by an average of 14 deaths/100,000 live births per year, while SIDS incidence remained constant. Risk ratios of SIDS/total infant deaths, standardized to Non-Hispanic White, were 1.76/2.41 for Non-Hispanic Black and 0.49/0.97 for Hispanic infants. Increased SIDS risk was significantly and independently associated with male infant sex, Non-Hispanic Black maternal race/ethnicity, young maternal age, low prenatal care, gestational age {$<$}39 weeks, birthweight {$<$}2500 g, low maternal education, and maternal tobacco use (p {$<$} 0.01). Maternal previous children now deceased also trended toward association with increased SIDS risk., Conclusions: A thorough SIDS risk assessment should include maternal, socioeconomic, and environmental risk factors as these are associated with SIDS in our population.},
