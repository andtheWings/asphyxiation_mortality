## Supplement 1: Analytic Pipeline and Custom Functions

### Pipeline Overview

We hosted both the [code](https://github.com/andtheWings/cook_county_sids_mortality) and [manuscript](https://github.com/andtheWings/cook_county_suid_manuscript) on Github.

We orchestrated the data pipeline for the data analysis with the package {[targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)}.

```{r}
library(targets)
```

If working with this repository and you want a visual overview of the pipeline, you can execute:

```{r eval=FALSE}
tar_visnetwork()
```

Here is information on the R session and its dependencies:

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
