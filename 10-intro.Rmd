## Introduction

Estimating epidemiological risk with a fine level of geographic detail allows public health departments to target their limited resources to the precise areas with highest needs, but accurate estimation presents a series of linked challenges. To illustrate, this paper considers the risk of sudden unexpected infant death in census tracts of Cook County, IL from 2015 to 2019. First, identifying cases of SUID is a labor-intensive process. By definition, a diagnosis of SUID means that an infant less than one year old died without known cause prior to medical autopsy. Historically, analysts have needed to manually review medical records in order to verify cases. If the review process takes too long, practitioners are left with stale estimates and emerging hot spots might be left unidentified. Here, we outline an automated process for querying these cases from Cook County Medical Examiner's Office records.

A second challenge is that SUID is (thankfully) a rare event and the geographic areas are small. A sizable majority of census tracts in Cook County did not observe any events of SUID from 2015-2019. If we estimate risk purely from observed data, we might naively conclude that the risk of SUID in the majority of tracts was zero, when in fact we're facing issues with detecting risk that is quite small, but not zero. Here, we use Bayesian estimation of a beta distribution to combine observed data with prior expectations to create more principled estimates.

A third challenge is we know the denominator of risk--the number of live births--for the county as a whole, but not for each individual census tract. Without a fine-grained understanding of the denominator, we cannot scale estimates of risk such that our prior expectations and observed data have similarly weighted impacts. Here we approximate the denominator using the population of children under 5 in each tract obtained from the U.S. Census.

A fourth challenge is we want to fine tune our prior expectations of risk by using knowledge of other socioeconomic factors in each census tract, which we accomplish using a nested negative binomial regression model of the expected count of SUID deaths.

A final challenge is that standard regression models treat each census tract as geographically independent from all others. Here, we incorporate autoregression techniques such that the risk in one tract can diffuse across borders to adjust the expected risk in geographically proximate tracts.

Demonstrating the cumulative value of all the solutions outlined above, this paper will map how estimations of risk change after each challenge is addressed.
