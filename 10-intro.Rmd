## Introduction

### Background

Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) exacts a severe, lasting toll on bereaved family members and society at large. 
At the familial level, loss of an infant may put caregivers--especially birth mothers--at heightened risk for Prolonged Grief Disorder where the process of healing and acceptance evades realization [@goldsteinGriefMothersSudden2018]. 
At the societal level, 20% of all post-neonatal infant deaths in the United States are ascribed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a subset of SUID [@GBDCompare].

United States health agencies define SUID as "the death of an infant younger than 1 year of age that occurs suddenly and unexpectedly". 
Sometimes, medical investigation identifies a cause (e.g. suffocation/entrapment related to unsafe sleep conditions), but when a full investigation does not reveal a cause, such cases are defined as SIDS [@CommonSIDSSUID].

The "Back to Sleep" campaign initiated in 1994 helped significantly reduce rates of SUID at global, national, and Illinois state levels. However, further reductions have not been achieved since the early 2000's [@shapiro-mendozaEpidemiologySuddenInfant2018; @SIDSSleepRelatedInfant]. 
One barrier to mortality prevention efforts has been the inequitable distribution of protective factors in different communities leading to disparate outcomes. 
For example, the White population of Illinois had a SUID rate of about 64 cases per 100,000 infants in 2014, while the Black population had a rate of about 172 per 100,000 [@SIDSSleepRelatedInfant].

Inequities may be obscured on the geographic dimension when summarizing information at the country or state level, but stark contrasts emerge when disaggregating to more granular levels. 
This may be because historic forces of racial and socioeconomic segregation (e.g. redlining and racial covenants) were enforced at the neighborhood level [@rothsteinColorLawForgotten2017].

Proponents of precision public health argue that fine-grained characterization not only of location, but also time, demographics, risk/protective factors, and outcomes enables health service providers to intervene on behalf of communities most disparately impacted by conditions like SUID. 
Without precision, providers risk exacerbating inequity by bolstering resources in areas already well-supplied, while neglecting areas with highest need [@hortonOfflineDefencePrecision2018]. 
However, precision is necessary but not sufficient if findings can't be delivered in a timely, yet accurate manner.
Without timely, accurate results, practitioners are left with stale estimates and emerging hot spots might be left unidentified. 
Recent studies underscore the challenges inherent in striking such a balance [@macdonaldComparingAsphyxiaUnexplained2022].

### Objectives

Here we describe efforts by the Cook County Health Center for Health Equity and Innovation (CCH CHEI) to develop tools striking a balance between precision, accuracy, and timeliness when analyzing SUID cases in our county. 
Our team developed a semi-automated pipeline for querying SUID data from the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office, geocoding each case, aggregating to the census tract level, enriching with data from the U.S. Census American Community Survey, summarizing into descriptive tables, generating interactive maps, and modeling census tract case counts.
Once constructed, the pipeline can refresh upon arrival of new data with minimal effort from the practitioner.
