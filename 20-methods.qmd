## Methods

### Data Sources and Manipulation

\[Description of how CCME data was obtained and of the query for teasing out SUID cases\]. We sought all cases of SUID that occurred within Cook County, IL during the time period of 2015-2019.

Validity of SUID case identifications was assessed by team members from the Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Case Registry for Cook County \[CITATION\].

\[Description of the geocoding process\]. After geocoding, counts of SUID cases were aggregated to the census tract level.

We sourced census-tract level variables from U.S. Census' American Community Survey (###) by \[team's method before data delivered to Daniel\].

### Pipeline

All steps in the data pipeline downstream from those described above were performed in the R computing environment while relying heavily on the {tidyverse} suite of package extensions. Data cleaning additionally utilized convenience functions from the {janitor} package. The pipeline itself was orchestrated by specification using the {targets} package.

Data tables were constructed using the {gt} package and its derivative {gtsummary}.

Geospatial manipulation and mapping were performed using the {sf} and {leaflet} packages.

### Model

A model was specified in the pipeline to further demonstrate how data can be automatically fed into analytic outputs. 
The {tidymodels} and {easystats} suites of packages were used to construct and assess the model. 
The model outcome was prediction of the SUID case count in each census tract of Cook County. 
Because this is a count variable, we decided to use a generalized linear model using the negative binomial distribution. 
Negative binomial was chosen instead of the Poisson distribution because overdispersion was detected in the outcome.

Data was divided into spatially-clustered folds using {spatialsample} package. 80% of the data was apportioned from the each of the folds to training the model and 20% to testing performance.

Model predictors are outlined in @tbl-predictors. 
The model was not structured to quantify causal effects of these predictors.
The count of opioid-related deaths was hypothesized to reflect similar patterns of count variability at the census tract level. 
Percentage on public insurance was intended as a proxy for overall access to and quality of healthcare for each census tract population. 
Percentage of Non-Hispanic Whites was selected because this group has been conceptualized as the primary beneficiaries of systemic racism, which we hypothesized influences rates of SUID. 
These predictors were selected from a broader pool initially by strength of their correlation coefficients with SUID case count and subsequently by their effect on model performance metrics like AIC, BIC, RMSE, and Nagelkerke's R^2. 
The {performance} package provided useful heuristic methods during this process.

: Predictor Variables {#tbl-predictors}

There was no explicitly missing data from the analysis in the sense that each census tract had an estimate for the outcome value and its predictors. 
However, these estimates may be influenced by biases in data collection leading to under- or over-counting.

Once the final model was selected, we calibrated it on the training set, then assessed the same performance metrics on the test set.
