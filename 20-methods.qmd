## Methods

### Study Design, Setting, Variables, and Sources

We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective study concerning cases of SUID in census tracts of Cook County, IL.

The vintage of a variable was context-specific.
The overall chronological scheme was to observe the SUID outcome from 2015-2019, compare descriptive variables from 2019 in census tracts with and without SUID observed, use older variables from 2014 for model training, and use newer variables from 2020 for model predictions of the future period of 2021-2025 (@tbl-variables).

For the outcome, *Description from collaborator of how CCME data was obtained and of the query for teasing out SUID cases* [@MedicalExaminerCasea]. 
Validity of SUID case identifications was assessed by team members from the Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Case Registry for Cook County \[CITATION\]. 
*Description from collaborator of the geocoding process.* 
After geocoding, counts of SUID cases were aggregated by count to the census tract level. 

There were 1315 census tracts with non-zero populations included in our analysis from 2014-2019.
In 2020, tracts were slightly redrawn for the decennial census, so we made forward predictions on the new set of 1,331 census tracts with non-zero populations.

We sourced all other tract-level variables from U.S. Census' "American Community Survey" (ACS-5) and from CDC data products "PLACES: Local Data for Better Health" and the "Social Vulnerability Index" (SVI) [@AmericanCommunitySurvey; @PLACESLocalData; @SocialVulnerabilityIndex].

### Pipeline

We performed all steps in the data pipeline downstream from the SQL query in the R computing environment [@ProgrammingLanguage] while relying heavily on the {tidyverse} suite of packages [@TidyversePackageSuite]. 
Data cleaning additionally utilized convenience functions from the {janitor} and {RSocrata} packages [@samfirkeJanitorPackage; @hughdevlinRSocrataPackage]. 
The pipeline was orchestrated by specification using the {targets} package [@williammichaellandauTargetsPackage].

We constructed data tables using the {gt} package and its companion {gtsummary} [@richardiannoneGtPackage; @danield.sjobergGtsummaryPackage].

We performed geospatial manipulation and mapping with the {sf}, {leaflet}, {opencage}, and {tigris} packages [@edzerpebesmaSfPackage; @LeafletPackage; @danielpossenriedeOpencagePackage; @kylewalkerTigrisPackage] along with their back-end infrastructure [@CARTOBasemapStyles; @frankwarmerdamGDAL; @GEOS; @volodymyragafonkinLeaflet; @OpenCageGeocodingAPI; @OpenStreetMap; @PROJ; @TIGERDataProducts]. 

### Descriptive Comparison

We performed descriptive analysis for comparing tracts with and without SUID by comparing median values (with IQRâ€™s). 
This is because most of the distributions were not normal.

### Model

We modeled SUID case counts in each census tract using maximum likelihood estimation in the {MASS} package [@brianripleyMASSPackage]. We used the negative binomial family of generalized linear models instead of the Poisson family because overdispersion was detected.

We modeled presence of SUID in each census tract using logistic regression in base R (also by maximum likelihood estimation).

The {easystats} suite of packages was used to assess each model on metrics like area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC; ROC), sensitivity, specificity, Akaike/Bayesian information criteria (AIC; BIC), and R<sup>2</sup> [@danielludeckeEasystatsPackageSuite].

<!-- Data was divided into spatially-clustered folds using {spatialsample} package. 80% of the data was apportioned from the each of the folds to training the model and 20% to testing performance. -->

We selected model prediction variables from the full pool of variables used to compute SVI [@SocialVulnerabilityIndex].
We ultimately settled on using the estimated percentage of unemployed residents (ep_unemp) and the estimated percentage of minority residents (ep_minrty) due to a combination of high Pearson correlation coefficients with outcome and each belonging to different thematic domains of the SVI.
We found that inclusion of more than two predictor variables decreased the overall performance of the model.
The model was *not* structured to quantify causal effects of these predictors.

### Missing Data

There was no explicitly missing data from the analysis in the sense that each census tract had an estimate for the outcome value and its predictors. However, these estimates could have been influenced by biases in data collection leading to under- or over-counting.
