# Describing SIDS Deaths

```{r include=FALSE}
df <- readRDS("data/df.RDS")
```

Our primary outcome in the analysis is:

`count_asphyxia` = the count of SIDS deaths in each census tract

This is a count-type outcome, which is typically modeled using the Poisson or Negative Binomial distributions. I will be using the Negative Binomial, since the Poisson is limited by having its variance needing to be equal to its mean. 

Here we visualize the `count_asphyxia` distribution of count frequencies.

```{r}
DataExplorer::plot_histogram(df$count_asphyxia)
```

As expected, the majority of census tracts do not have any SIDS-related deaths.

It's a little hard to see the tail of the distribution so let's tabulate:

```{r}
janitor::tabyl(df$count_asphyxia)[,1:2]
```
