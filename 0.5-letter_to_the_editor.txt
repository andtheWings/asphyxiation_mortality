Dear Dr. Sanchez,

We present for your consideration our manuscript entitled “Using Social Vulnerability Indices to Predict Priority Areas for Prevention of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death in Cook County, IL: Cross-Sectional Study”. Cook County spans a large geographic area with a dense, highly diverse population. This work was born out of the need of local public health practitioners to have some means of prioritizing and targeting their interventions for greater efficacy. We sought to develop practical tools to aid in decision-making that were statistically rigorous, yet simple to understand. One key output of this work was an interactive map of case counts available on the first author's personal website: http://danielriggins.com/widgets/suid_counts_cook_county_communities.html.
