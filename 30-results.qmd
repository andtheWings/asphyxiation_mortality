### Case Identification

Our SQL query identified 333 prospective cases of SUID from the medical examiner archives. Representatives from the SUID Case Registry of Cook County reviewed the cases and recommended retaining 325.

<!-- Our SQL query identified 333 prospective cases of SUID from the medical examiner archives. Representatives from the SUID Case Registry of Cook County recommended the addition of XXX cases and removal of XXX cases. Our query identified XXX cases that were not in the registry, but deemed to be valid additions. This process yielded XXX SUID cases in total. -->

<!-- We tabulated descriptive characteristics of validated SUID cases (Table XXX). -->

<!-- We compared the distributions of select characteristics compared to those in the overall population of Cook County children under the age of 5 (derived from the census). -->

<!-- SUID cases had a higher prevalence of Black infants and favored location in Chicago (vs. Cook County Suburbs) compared to the reference population. -->

### Geospatial Aggregation

We spatially aggregated cases into counts within 199 communities. 
49% of communities (97/199) observed at least one case of SUID from 2015-2019. 
@tbl-suid-counts shows the full distribution of case counts.

<!-- In 2019, there were 1,319 total census tracts in Cook County. Four tracts had estimated populations of zero and respectively covered Lake Michigan, Midway International Airport, O'Hare International Airport, and Robert Rochon Taylor Park. We excluded these four tracts from the rest of the analysis. 237 of 1315 analyzed tracts had at least one case of SUID present from 2015-2019 (@tbl-suid-counts). -->

### Mapping SUID Case Counts

We generated an interactive map of SUID case counts [@fig-map-suid-overview].
Broadly speaking, the map showed subjective clusters of cases on the West and South Sides of Chicago [@fig-map-suid-chicago] as well as the South Suburbs of Cook County [@fig-map-suid-south-suburbs].
The top five communities with the largest case counts were all located in Chicago city limits: Austin (17), Englewood (17), West Englewood (14), West Pullman (11), and Humboldt Park (10).
The community outside of city limits with the largest case count was Chicago Heights (7).

### Comparing Tracts With and Without SUID

@tbl-by-suid-present compares basic demographics of communities with at least one case of SUID versus those without. 
There were no meaningful differences in age or sex composition, however, communities with SUID present exhibited lower composition of Non-Hispanic White residents at 17% (IQR 4-49) vs. 60% (IQR 31-76) [@fig-white-comp] and higher composition of Non-Hispanic Black residents at 32% (IQR 6-79) vs. 3% (IQR 2-10) [@fig-black-comp], although the interquartile ranges for these estimates overlapped. 
Variables algorithmically selected for use in the predictive model also showed meaningful differences.

### Modeling SUID Case Counts

We fit a negative binomial regression model to predict SUID case counts for each community of Cook County based on total population, total people living below the poverty line, and total households with more occupants than rooms ("crowded" households) [@tbl-parameters]. 
The model was retrospectively trained on SUID case counts for 2015-2019 with predictor variables from the 2014 SVI/ACS. 
@fig-rootogram depicts goodness of fit for the model on the training data, showing that it captured mid-range counts well, but under-predicted the number of communities with zero cases, over-predicted those with one case, and under-predicted those with counts over 6.
See Supplement 1 for further details on model selection and evaluation of performance.

IRR = Incidence Rate Ratio, interpreted as the magnitude by which you would multiply the risk with a unit increase of 1 for each covariate
SE = Standard Error
95% CI = 95% Confidence Interval
z = Standardized Z-score
p = P-value

Observed case counts are the bars "hanging" from predicted case counts pinned at the dots. For under-predictions, the bar will hang below zero, for over-predictions, the bar will hang above zero.

The median difference between predicted and observed case counts in the training data was 0.24 (IQR -0.57, 0.60).
All five communities with the highest observed case counts (Austin, Englewood, West Englewood, West Pullman, and Humboldt Park) were also among the communities with the most significant individual under-predictions (ranging from 4.05 to 7.61 less than that observed).
On the other end of the spectrum, the five communities with the most significant individual over-predictions were Douglas, Grand Boulevard, Kenwood, Rogers Park, and Chicago Lawn (ranging from 2.94 to 4.77 more than that observed).

### Prospective Model Predictions

We applied predictor variables from the 2020 SVI/ACS to our trained model to predict case counts for 2021-2025. 
Based on shifting demographics in the predictor variables, the model predicted the five communities with the highest case counts would be Austin (17), Englewood (14), Auburn Gresham (12), Chicago Lawn (12), and South Shore (11) for this time period (Data available in Supplement 2).
